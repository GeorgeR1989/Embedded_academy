Final notes:
- Each file will be incrementally added. GitHub is a revisioning tool that allows using the same name on various file revisions
- Track each change using Git's difference tool, in order to see what was added, what was changed, what was removed and perform reviews on these modifications
- Every time you make a modification, add relevant notes regarding the modifications made. For new items, add "Initial revision"
