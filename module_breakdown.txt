Hint: Gather the documentation of the physical sensor and construct the mechanism that generate the proper outputs

2) Pushbutton module
The module should be able to handle the inputs from the PCB's push buttons
Hint: Implement a debouncer that will record properly the key stroke.

3) RGB LED module
The module should be able to calculate the proper values for the PWM which will controll the RGB LED of the PCB

4) Joystick module
The module should be able to handle the inputs from the PCB's joystick
Hint: Implement a debouncer that will record properly the joystick selection

5) OLED display handling module
The module should be able to receive the information from other modules and to display it

6) Rotary button module 
The module should be able to handle the input from the rotary button.
Hint: Implement a debouncer that will record properly the position of the rotary button

7) Buzzer module
The module should be able to receive input information and to output it as sound with various frequency

8) Segment display module
The module should be able to display all possible digits/letter combinations for one symbol
